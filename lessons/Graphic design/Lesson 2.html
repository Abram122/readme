                <h3 style="color: lightskyblue;">The fundamental types of graphic design:</h3><br>
                
                <h5>  <span style="color: red;">Visual identity graphic design</span> <br>  <br>
                    A brand is a relationship between a business or organization and its <br>
                    audience.<br>
                    A brand identity is how the organization communicates its personality, tone <br>
                    and essence, as well as memories, emotions and experiences. <br>
                    Visual identity graphic design is exactly that: the visual elements of brand <br>
                    identity that act as the face of a brand to communicate those intangible <br>
                    qualities through images, shapes and color.<br> <br>
                    <span style="color: red;"> Marketing & advertising graphic design</span>  <br> <br>
                    When most people think of graphic design, they think of designs created for <br>
                    marketing and advertising.<br>
                    Companies depend on successful marketing efforts to tap into their target <br>
                    audience’s decision-making process. <br>
                    Great marketing engages people based on the wants, needs, awareness and <br>
                    satisfaction they have about a product, service or brand. <br>
                    Since people will always find visual content more engaging, graphic design <br>
                    helps organizations promote and communicate more effectively.<br>
                    Marketing designers work with company owners, directors, managers or <br>
                    marketing professionals to create assets for marketing strategies.<br>
                    They might work alone or as part of an in-house or creative team. <br>
                    Designers can specialize in a specific type of media (vehicle wraps or <br>
                    magazine ads, for example) or create a broad assortment of collateral for <br> <br>
                    print, digital, and beyond.<br><br>
                    <span style="color: red;">User interface graphic design</span>    <br> <br>
                    A user interface (UI) is how a user interacts <br>
                    with a device or application.<br>
                    UI design is the process of designing <br>
                    interfaces to make them easy to use and <br>
                    provide a user-friendly experience.<br>
                    A UI includes all of the things a user <br>
                    interacts with the screen, keyboard and <br>
                    mouse but in the context of graphic design, UI design focuses on the <br>
                    user’s visual experience and the design of on-screen graphic elements <br>
                    like buttons, menus, micro-interactions, and more. <br>
                    It’s a UI designer’s job to balance aesthetic appeal with technical <br>
                    functionality.<br> <br>
                    <span style="color: red;">Motion graphic design</span>    <br> <br>
                    Simply put, motion graphics are graphics that are in motion. <br>
                    This can include animation, audio, typography, imagery, video and other <br>
                    effects that are used in online media, television and film. <br>
                    The medium’s popularity has skyrocketed in recent years as technology <br>
                    improved and video content became king.<br>
                    “Motion graphics designer” is a somewhat new specialty for designers.<br>
                    Formally reserved for TV and film, technological advances have reduced <br>
                    production time and costs, making the art form more accessible and <br>
                    affordable. <br>
                    Now, motion graphics is one of the newest types of design and can be found <br>
                    across all digital platforms, which has created all sorts of new areas and <br>
                    opportunities.<br> <br>
                    <span style="color: red;"> Art and illustration for graphic design</span>   <br> <br>
                    Graphic art and illustration are often seen as <br>
                    being the same as graphic design, however, <br>
                    they’re each very different. <br>
                    Designers create compositions to <br>
                    communicate and solve problems, graphic <br>
                    artists and illustrators create original artwork. <br>
                    Their art takes a number of forms, from fine <br>
                    art to decoration to storytelling illustrations.<br>
                    Even though graphic art and illustration are not technically types of graphic <br>
                    design, so much is created for commercial use within the context of graphic <br>
                    design that you can’t talk about one without the others</h5>
