                <h3 style="color: lightskyblue;">What is graphic design?</h3>
                <h5 style="font-weight: 400;"> <span style="color: red;">Graphic design</span>  is defined as “the art and practice  <br>
                    of planning and projecting ideas and experiences <br>
                    with visual and textual content.” In other terms, <br>
                    graphic design communicates certain ideas or <br>
                    messages in a visual way. These visuals can be as <br>
                    simple as a business logo, or as complex as page <br>
                    layouts on a website. <br> <br>
                    “Graphic design takes graphical and textual <br>
                    elements and implements them into multiple types of media,” says designer <br>
                    <span style="color: red;">Alexandros Clufetos</span> , when asked to elaborate on the graphic design <br>
                    definition. “It helps the producer connect with the consumer. It conveys the <br> 
                    message of the project, event, campaign or product.”<br> <br>
                    Graphic design can be used by companies to promote and sell products <br>
                    through advertising, by websites to convey complicated information in a <br>
                    digestible way through infographics, or by businesses to develop an identity <br> 
                    through branding, among other things. <br> <br>
                    “Every day, we take many of the subtly artistic things around us for granted. <br> 
                    But hidden in every magazine corner, exit sign or textbook lies a set of <br>
                    design ideas that influence our perceptions,” says Jacob Smith, founder of <br>
                    illustration studio. <br> <br>
                    It’s also important to remember that although many graphic design projects <br>
                    have commercial purposes like advertisements and logos, it is also used in <br>
                    other contexts and graphic design work is often created purely as a means <br>
                    for artistic expression</h5> <br> 
                    <h3 style="color: lightskyblue;">Types of graphic design?</h3>
                    <h5>
                        <span style="color: red;">Website design</span>  involves creating engaging and intuitive web pages for users.  <br>
                        This includes overall layout, color scheme and navigation. <br> <br>
                        <span style="color: red;">User experience (UX)</span>  design is focused on ensuring a website or application <br>
                        is easy and satisfying to use. These designers emphasize value, usability, <br>
                        adoptability and desirability. <br> <br>
                        <span style="color: red;">Motion graphics</span>  design or <span style="color: red;">animation</span>  brings visual elements to life through <br>
                        special effects, TV shows, video games and movies <br> <br>
                    </h5>
                    <h3 style="color: lightskyblue;">Graphic design basics</h3>
                    <h5>To better understand the meaning of graphic design, it is important to be  <br>
                        aware of the elements and principles that make up design. Elements are <br>
                        used in conjunction or opposition with each other to create visually striking <br>
                        and impactful designs. <br>
                      <span style="color: red;"> These graphic design elements include:</span>  <br>
                        Color <br>
                        Form <br>
                        Line <br>
                        Shape <br>
                        Size <br>
                        Space <br>
                        Texture <br>
                        Graphic designers also adhere to the principles of design, which are  <br>
                        essentially a set of guidelines that help a design achieve effective  <br>
                        composition. These basic principles aid in creating balance and stability for  <br>
                        the piece of work. <br>
                        <span style="color: red;"> These graphic design principles include: </span>  <br>
                        Balance <br>
                        Contrast<br>
                        Emphasis<br>
                        Movement<br>
                        Proportion<br>
                        Rhythm<br>
                        You’ve heard the old saying that “<span style="color: red;">rules are meant to be broken</span>” which can  <br>
                        certainly ring true in this case. But a good graphic designer must first  <br>
                        understand these principles before making the conscious decision to break  <br>
                        them. <br>
