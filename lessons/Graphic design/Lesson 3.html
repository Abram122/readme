                 <span style="color: red;">  Adobe Photoshop</span>  <br><br>
                 <span style="color: red;">Adobe Photoshop </span>   is a raster graphics editor developed  <br>
                    and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It <br>
                    was originally created in 1987 by Thomas and John Knoll. <br>
                    Since then, the software has become the most used tool <br>
                    for professional digital art, especially in raster graphics<br> 
                    editing. The software's name is often colloquially used as <br>
                    a verb (e.g. "to Photoshop an image",  "<span style="color: red;">photoshopping</span>", <br>
                    and "Photoshop contest") although Adobe discourages such <br>
                    use.<br>
                    Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and <br>
                    supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models. Photoshop <br>
                    uses its own PSD and PSB file formats to support these features. In addition <br>
                    to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities to edit or render text and <br>
                    vector graphics (especially through clipping path for the latter), as well as 3d<br>
                    graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; programs <br>
                    developed and distributed independently of Photoshop that run inside it and <br>
                    offer new or enhanced features.<br>
                    Photoshop's naming scheme was initially based on version numbers. <br>
                    However, in October 2002 (following the introduction of Creative Suite <br>
                    branding), each new version of Photoshop was designated with "CS" plus a <br>
                    number; e.g., the eighth major version of Photoshop was Photoshop CS and <br>
                    the ninth was Photoshop CS2. Photoshop CS3 through CS6 were also <br>
                    introduction of the Creative Cloud branding in June 2013 (and in turn, the <br>
                    change of the "CS" suffix to "CC"), Photoshop's licensing scheme was<br>
                    changed to that of software as a service subscription model. Historically,<br> 
                    Photoshop was bundled with additional software such as Adobe Image<br>
                    Ready, Adobe Fireworks, Adobe Bridge, Adobe Device Central and Adobe <br>
                    Camera RAW.<br>
                    Alongside Photoshop, Adobe also develops and publishes Photoshop <br>
                    Elements, Photoshop Lightroom, Photoshop Express, Photoshop Fix, Adobe <br>
                    Illustrator, and Photoshop Mix. As of November 2019, Adobe has also <br>
                    released a full version of Photoshop for the iPad, and while initially limited, <br>
                    Adobe plans to bring more features to Photoshop for iPad.<br>
                    Collectively, they are branded as "The Adobe Photoshop Family".<br><br>
                    <span style="color: red;"> Adobe Illustrator</span>  <br><br>
                    <span style="color: red;">Adobe Illustrator</span>    is a vector graphics editor and design <br>
                    program developed and marketed by Adobe Inc.<br>
                    Originally designed for the Apple Macintosh, <br>
                    development of Adobe Illustrator began in 1985.<br>
                    Along with Creative Cloud (Adobe's shift to monthly or <br>
                    annual subscription service delivered over the <br>
                    Internet), Illustrator CC was released.<br>
                    The latest version, Illustrator 2023, was released on October 18, 2022, and <br>
                    is the 27th generation in the product line.<br>
                    Adobe Illustrator was reviewed as the best vector graphics editing program <br>
                    in 2021 by PC Magazine.<br><br>
                    <span style="color: red;">  Adobe Premiere Pro</span> <br><br>
                    <span style="color: red;"> Adobe Premiere Pro</span>    is a timeline-based and non-linear video editing <br>
                    software application (NLE) developed by Adobe Inc. and published as part <br>
                    of the Adobe Creative Cloud licensing program. First launched in 2003, <br>
                    Adobe Premiere Pro is a successor of Adobe Premiere <br>
                    (first launched in 1991). It is geared towards professional <br>
                    video editing, while its sibling, Adobe Premiere Elements, <br>
                    targets the consumer market.<br>
                    CNN was an early adopter of Adobe Premiere Pro. Also, in <br>
                    2007, certain BBC departments adopted Premiere Pro. It <br>
                    has been used to edit feature films, such as Deadpool, <br>
                    Gone Girl,Captain Abu Raed, Terminator: Dark Fate and <br>
                    Monsters,and other venues such as Madonna's Confessions Tour<br>
