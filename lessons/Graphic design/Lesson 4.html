                    <span style="color: red;">What is user experience (UX) design?</span>    <br><br>
                    User experience design is a human-first way of designing products. Don <br>
                    Norman, a cognitive scientist and co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group <br>
                    Design Consultancy, is credited with coining the term “user experience” in <br>
                    the late 1990s. Here’s how he describes it:<br>
                    “User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with <br>
                    the company, its services, and its products.”<br>
                    – Don Norman, Cognitive Scientist & User Experience Architect<br>
                    Clear, right? Well you might note immediately that despite what I implied in <br>
                    the introduction, the definition has no reference to tech, no mention of <br>
                    digital, and doesn’t tell us all that much about what a UX designer actually <br>
                    does. But like all professions, it’s impossible to distill the process from just a <br>
                    few words.<br>
                    Still, Don Norman’s definition tells us that, regardless of its medium plenty <br>
                    of non-digital UX (and there’s lots out there!) UX Design encompasses any <br>
                    and all interactions between a potential or active customer and a company.<br>
                    As a scientific process it could be applied to anything; street lamps, cars, <br>
                    Ikea shelving, and so on.<br> <br>
                     <span style="color: red;">What is user interface (UI) design?</span>  <br><br>
                    Despite it being an older and more practiced field, the question “What is <br>
                    user interface design?” is difficult to answer because of its broad variety of <br>
                    misinterpretations.<br>
                    While user experience is a conglomeration of tasks focused on the <br>
                    optimization of a product for effective and enjoyable use, user interface <br>
                    design is its complement; the look and feel, the presentation and <br>
                    interactivity of a product.<br>
                    But like UX, it is easily and often confused by the industries that employ UI <br>
                    designers—to the extent that different job posts will often refer to the <br>
                    profession as completely different things.<br>
                    If you look at job ads and job descriptions for user interface designers, you <br>
                    will mostly find interpretations of the profession that are akin to graphic <br>
                    design, sometimes extending also to branding design, and even frontend <br>
                    development.<br>
                    If you look at “expert” definitions of User Interface Design, you will mostly <br>
                    find descriptions that are in part identical to User Experience Design—even <br>
                    referring to the same structural techniques.<br><br>
                    <span style="color: red;">What’s the difference between UX and UI design?</span>  <br> <br>
                    UX design is all about the overall feel of the experience, while UI design is <br>
                    all about how the product’s interfaces look and function.<br>
                    A UX designer considers the user’s entire journey to solve a particular <br>
                    problem; what steps do they take? What tasks do they need to complete? <br>
                    How straightforward is the experience?<br>
                    Much of their work focuses on finding out what kinds of problems and painpoints users come up against, and how a certain product might solve them. <br>
                    They’ll conduct extensive user research in order to find out who the target <br>
                    users are and what their needs are in relation to a certain product.<br>
                    They’ll then map out the user’s journey across a product, considering things <br>
                    like information architecture—i.e. how the content is organized and labelled <br>
                    across a product—and what kinds of features the user <br>
                    might need. Eventually, they’ll create <br>
                    wireframes which set out the bare-bones blueprints <br>
                    for the product.<br>
                    With the skeleton of the product mapped out, the UI <br>
                    designer steps in to bring it to life. The UI designer <br>
                    considers all the visual aspects of the user’s journey, <br>
                    including all the individual screens and touchpoints <br>
                    that the user might encounter; think tapping a <br>
                    button, scrolling down a page or swiping through an<br> 
                    image gallery.<br>
                    While the UX designer maps out the journey, the UI <br>
                    designer focuses on all the details that make this <br>
                    journey possible. That’s not to say that UI design is all <br>
                    about looks; UI designers have a huge impact on <br>
                    whether or not a product is accessible and inclusive.<br>
                    They’ll ask questions like “How can different color <br>
                    combinations be used to create contrast and enhance <br>
                    readability?” or “What color pairings cater to color <br>
                    blindness?” You can learn more about UI design for <br>
                    accessibility in our guide.<br>
