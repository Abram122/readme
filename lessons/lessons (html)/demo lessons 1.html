                <h5>
                Before you design you must plan first. <br>
                A well-designed website makes people’s lives easier. <br>
                Imagine yourself entering a website for a supermarket to buy some <br>
                snacks but it is not categorized to find the item you want, what will happen? <br>
                You will go through all the items and waste a lot of time looking for what you want. <br> 
                Good design creates experiences that makes people’s lives easier. <br>
                elements and implements them into multiple types of media,” says designer <br><br>
                <span style="color: red;">1.1.Examples of good designs : </span>
                Drivers can see well-designed road signs from a distance and the message of the <br>
                sign can be immediately understood, even at a high rate of speed while driving. <br>
                A well-designed chair is comfortable to sit in and fits in with the style of the room. <br><br>
                <span style="color: red;">1.2. The stages of the planning process</span>
                The designer’s goal is to create sites that serves the needs of the users. <br>
                The stages of the planning process can generally be defined <span style="color: red;">as :</span><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defining goals and strategy</li>
                    <li>Research</li>
                    <li>Information architecture</li>
                    <li>Sketching</li>
                    <li>Wire frames</li>
                    <li>Mockups</li>
                </ul>
                <span style="color: red;">1.2.1.Defining goals and strategy</span>
                When designing a website, an important question to ask is, <br>
                “Why does this website need toexist?” <br>
                Here are some of the questions that might arise in discussing <br>
                the functionality and design of  <span style="color: red;">such a site:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do You Want to Build a New Website or Redesign an Existing One?</li>
                    <li>What Services Do You Offer?</li>
                    <li>What Features Does Your Website Need to Be Successful</li>
                </ul>
                <span style="color: red;">1.2.2.Research</span>
                A designer needs to have some background on what the visitors to the website will be <br>
                expecting. Competitive research to other websites can be helpful. <br> <br>
                <span style="color: red;">1.2.3.Information Architecture</span>
                A website’s information architecture has two main components: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identification and definition of site content and functionality</li>
                    <li>The underlying organization, structure and nomenclature that define</li>
                </ul>
                <span style="color: red;">1.2.4.Sketching, Wireframes and Mockup</span>
                One of the benefits of creating wireframes, prototypes, and mockups <br>
                is to allow you to build your site more rapidly. <br>
                One popular method for exploring possible navigation in the <br>
                design phase is to use a pencil,sticky notes, and a blank wall. <br><br>
            </h5>
            <h3 style="color: lightskyblue;">2. Fundamentals of the web</h3>
            <h5>
                <span style="color: red;">2.1. How websites work</span>
                Have you asked yourself before what actually happens <br>
                when you open your web browser (Google chrome – Fire Fox ) <br>
                and type www.facebook.com. What actually happens once <br>
                you hit enter until the Facebook page appears to you. <br>
                It is clear that websites are just web pages that are saved on a webserver. <br>
                every PC or Server or any device on a network must have an IP address <br>
                any website on the Internet has an IP address <br><br>
                <span style="color: red;">2.2. Domain names and hosting</span>
                Domain names help users find their way around the Internet. <br>
                You already know
                domain names because they are commonly surrounded by www on the front and . <br>
                com on the end.Domains can also include various endings such as .org, .edu, and .gov. <br>
                Domain names exist because it is not very convenient for you to use or remember IP <br>
                addresses.Domain Name Servers (DNS) translate easy-to-understand domain names into <br>
                IP addresses. A DNS converts a familiar string of letters, the “domain name,” to the <br>
                numbered IP address. <br>
                Instead of typing the IP address 72.32.147.166 into a web browser, you can type the <br>
                domain name,such as www.digitalclassroombooks.com.A DNS on the Internet converts your <br>
                requested domain into the appropriate IP address, which routes your request to the <br>
                appropriate web server. <br>
                Because most companies want their web servers to be available all day, every day, they <br>
                are often maintained by web hosting companies. These firms are paid to maintain your <br>
                web server so that it is always accessible and running. <br>
                If you run a small website, they may put your site on a server that is shared with other <br>
                sites. For more demanding sites, or sites with sensitive information, a business will pay <br>
                higher fees for a dedicated server. Even large companies will often turn to hosting <br>
                businesses to maintain their web servers, although somecompanies may elect to place <br>
                their web servers within their own company. <br><br>
            </h5>
            <h3 style="color: lightskyblue;">3. Web design tools</h3>
            <h5>
                <span style="color: red;">3.1. The language of the web</span>
                Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, uses tags that enclose plain text. The tags <br>
                describe how the text should appear and the function of the text. The web browser <br>
                looks at the tags and displays them accordingly. A simple example of HTML text is: <br>
                <!-- <pre> <code><p>Do you want to have lunch?</p></code></pre> <br> -->
                The text to be displayed, Do you want to have lunch? is wrapped by two tags <br>
                indicating that it is a paragraph. The first tag is the opening tag <br>
                <!-- <pre><code><p> and the second is the closing tag </p>.</code></pre><br> -->
                These tags are generally not displayed in the browser, which <br>
                reads the text from the web server and formats the text as <br>
                a paragraph to display on the viewer’s screen. <br>
                HTML also lets designers create hyperlinks. <br>
                Hyperlinks are areas of text, images, buttons, or other parts of <br>
                a page where the viewer can click to navigate to additional <br>
                content. Clicking a link can open a new web page, site, document, video, or animation. <br>
                Modern websites often consist of pages with HTML or XHTML for the page structure <br>
                and content, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for the style, and JavaScript, <br>
                Flash, or Silverlight for theinteractivity. <br><br>
                <span style="color: red;">3.2. The web editor</span>
                HTML and CSS use text as their foundation. Because of this, even the simplest text <br>
                editor, such as TextEdit on the Mac or Notepad on the PC, is capable of creating web <br>
                pages. These basic text editing tools, however, lack features that help with web design <br>
                and development such as checking code syntax, organizing your site folders, and <br>
                uploading files to web servers. In addition to text editors, there are also fully featured <br>
                web editors and designtools, such as Adobe Dreamweaver and Microsoft Expression <br>
                Web. In this unit we are going to use either Atom or Visual studio code to write our HTML codes. <br>
